            <h2>The Warehouse</h2>
            <p>
Unlike other delivery services, we don’t have a brick-and-mortar grocery store. We operate out of a warehouse that is strictly for inventory and our delivery trucks. This keeps our overhead cost low and our prices affordable. 
            </p>

<h2>Delivery Schedule</h2>
            <p>
Having a fixed delivery schedule, we can efficiently package the produce and ship them out in a timely manner. While we can’t match 2-hour delivery or same day shipping, it allows us to have more competitive pricing.
                </p>

<h2>Inventory</h2>
                <p>
We make our customers place their orders a week in advance so we know what to order from our suppliers. This keeps our inventory relatively waste free and we won’t end up overstocked with items that ultimately make their way into the price of everything else. 
                    </p>

<h2>Why do we have a ‘Limited’ variety of produce?</h2>
                    <p>
This makes it easier for us to buy wholesale and it also makes it easier on your wallet! Plus, we carry all the basics so you’ll only have to shop elsewhere for special occasions. </p>
